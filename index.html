    <h2><Summary></Summary></h2>
    <p>
        I have been exposed to software skills, PSPICE to design
        analogue circuits and used MATLAB functions to simulate flow of electrical fields, 
        CATIA to design a chassis for a small electronic robot and Arduino to design a 
        software program used in navigating a line following robot. I am enthusiastic about 
        electronic design and integration of hardware and software systems
        and would like to gain more exposer in both. I have a deep interest in 
        learning more about new advancement in technology. I am determined to develop
        this through getting involved with other engineers by attending conferences/seminars/webinars.
        I am also open to take on volunteering and other opportunities to learn more.
